            <p>Hi, my name is Jayden. I am a year 10 student at East Doncaster Secondary. 
            I am currently 15 years old, but I am turning 16 this year. I am interested in IT
            and I enjoy <u>programming, gaming, editing and basketball</u>. I was born in New Zealand, but I moved
            here when I was a little over one. I have lived in <i>Australia</i> the rest of my life, essentially
            making me an Australian. My family came from China and some of my distant family has been living
            here in Doncaster East for <b>40 years</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>I like programming in C#, Python and HTML, but I am still learning. </b>
            I will eventually get to Javascript as well.
            <br>
            <br>
